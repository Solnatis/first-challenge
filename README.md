## Horiseon Refactoring, 3-23-2023

Changes I made to improve Horiseon's website were as follows;

1.) Improved overall flow of CSS and conglomerated repeated CSS ID's and Classes using a class named "ablock" and "mblock" 

2.) Improved semantic HTML elements to be up to code for Accessibility standards.

3.) Added keywords to improve SEO

4.) added view-port scaling to improve compatibility.
