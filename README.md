# Horieson Website Refactoring (Challenge 1)
## Description
During my time working for Horieson, I found a couple of things to and did improve upon on there homepage.

## HTML

Inside Horiseons homepage, I discovered that the use of Semantic elements were not in place, there were no keywords to improve SEO, and there was no title for the page. 

I have now implemented the elements - nav, ul, section, sidebar, aside, and proper img alt names into there HTML

## CSS

Inspecting Horieson's style.css sheet, I discovered numerous amounts of repeating classes and tags that simply bulked up the sheet and were unnecessary. 

I have collaborted all of the aside elements belonging to the "benefits" class into the class [.ablock] and the respective aside image classes into the [.ablock img] class. This section can found under the "Sidebar Images & Content" in the HTML. 

In the same effort, I have also collaborted the main "content" classes into the ["mblock"] tag and the respective section image classes into the ["mblock img"]. These changes can be viewed under the HTML section labeled "Main Section Content & Images".
